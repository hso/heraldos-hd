This project aims to provide correct King's Heralds' music.

Each song can have vocal music, instrumental music or both.

The music is typeset using GNU Lilypond <http://lilypond.org/>.

All of it is reverse engineered by ear from the original records. The
quality of some of them is pretty low, so I may have skipped a note or
two. You're welcome to send patches.

Enjoy.
